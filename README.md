# JSON test suite

This is a repo to hold some useful test cases for JSON parser/serializer.

## Usage

At first, clone this repo to your local:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/acrazing/json-test-suite
```

`git submodule` or `git subtree` is recommended

And then, all the files end up with `.json` is the test case except `package.json` is the
holder for `yarn` and the `all_*.json` is the all of the cases. each one of the test case
contains two file `NAME_inline.json` and `NAME_loose.json`, first one means no whitespace
between tokens, and second one is more readable.

## PR is welcome

All the `*.json` is generated by [generate.ts](./generate.ts), you can modify it in any shape.

## TODO

- [ ] error cases

## LICENSE

None, you can do anything with this.
